# Writingway 2
**AI-powered creative writing tool — simple, friendly, and built for storytellers**

---

## 🌟 What is Writingway 2?

**Writingway 2** is a simple, powerful, and beginner‑friendly creative writing application designed for **writers**, not programmers.

It runs **entirely in your browser**, requires **no installation**, and stores all your work **locally** on your computer.  
Just **download → unzip → double‑click `start.bat` → begin writing**.

Writingway 2 is the successor to the original Writingway (Python/QML version).  
Unlike its predecessor, this new version is built with **JavaScript + HTML**, making it lightweight, portable, and extremely accessible to users with minimal technical experience.
